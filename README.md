# DungeonsAndDragonsScripts
Bash scripts created to randomly generate Dungeons and Dragongs 5th Edition content

# Current Status

Currently, the project generates a random race, class, gender, and name for a Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition (D&D5e) character. The race and class are generated by randomly selecting a race and class from `https://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/`. The gender is randomly assigned as either `male`, `female`, or `non-binary`. The name for the character is selected randomly from `https://muna.ironarachne.com/` with the input of race and gender (please note: for non-binary characters, no gender field was added for name generation).


# Running the Project
