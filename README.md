# DnDScripts
Bash scripts created to randomly generate Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition content

# Current Status

Currently, the project generates a random race, class, gender, and name for a Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition (D&D5e) character. The race and class are generated by randomly selecting a race and class from `https://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/`. The gender is randomly assigned as either `male`, `female`, or `non-binary`. The name for the character is selected randomly from `https://muna.ironarachne.com/` with the input of race and gender (please note: for non-binary characters, no gender field was added for name generation).

I am currently working on generating additional character information (subrace, level, etc) and am considering allowing user input for some fields.

I will in the future be working on:
* Using an AI generative text model to create a backstory for the generated character
* Using an AI text to image API to create portraits of the character generated (most likely through Huggingface)
* Filling a formfillable pdf of a character sheet with all generated content
